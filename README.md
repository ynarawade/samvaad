## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following software installed on your machine:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
-   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/ynarawade/samvaad.git](https://github.com/ynarawade/samvaad.git)
    cd samvaad
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables**
    -   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:
        ```sh
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    -   Update the `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file with your PostgreSQL connection string. It should look something like this:
        ```env
        DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE_NAME"
        JWT_SECRET="your_super_secret_jwt_key"
        # Add other environment variables as needed
        ```

4.  **Run Database Migrations**
    -   Push the schema changes to your database using Prisma:
        ```sh
        npx prisma migrate dev
        ```
    -   This will create the necessary tables in your PostgreSQL database.

5.  **Run the Application**
    -   Start the development server:
        ```sh
        npm run dev
        ```

The application should now be running! Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
